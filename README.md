# Crypto.com-QA-Takehome-Test-Project
 Project journey and the final output

## Week 1
*November 27th, 2023 - December 3rd, 2023*

Embarking on my journey towards becoming a QA automation engineer, I spent the first week for laying a solid foundation. I aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of QA automation by following along the introductory QA courses, before proceeding with the take-home test. 

### Key Learnings:  
- **Test levels**: Grasped the concept of three levels of tests - Unit, Service, and UI tests
- **BDD Understanding**: Acquired insights into Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and its application in the QA process.  
- **Environment Configuration**: Explored the environment for QA automation, including the configuration of a virtual environment. Installed and configured tools such as Selenium, Chromedriver, Behave, pytest, and pytest-bdd.  
- **Web Element Locators**: Delved into web element locators, focusing on CSS selectors and XPath.
- **BDD Tools**: Understood the purposes and use cases of Selenium and pytest-bdd in QA automation
### Learning Resources:  
- [Setting a Foundation for Successful Test Automation](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/setting-a-foundation-for-successful-test-automation/) on Test Automation University
- [Introduction to Pytest](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/pytest-tutorial/) on Test Automation University
- [Web Element Locator Strategies](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/web-element-locator-strategies/) on Test Automation University
- [Selenium WebDriver with Python](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/selenium-webdriver-python-tutorial/) on Test Automation University
- [Behavior Driven Python with pytest-bdd](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/behavior-driven-python-with-pytest-bdd/) on Test Automation University
### Plans for Next Week  
- To dive deeper into the implementation of web element locators with Selenium  
- To explore the functionalities and applications of pytest-bdd in QA automation process

## Week 2
*December 3rd, 2023 - December 10th, 2023*

This week was a bit challenging as I had to fight the flu with my completely blocked nostrils. Despite the health condition, I managed to revisit and dive deeper into some of the topics covered last week.

### Key Learnings: 
- **Virtual environment optimization**: Discovered that the default virtualenv provided by PyCharm isn't the best fit for pytest, leading to module missing errors. Switching to venv resolved these issues effectively.
- **Exception handling in pytest**: Learned how to use `pytest.raises` as a context manager in pytest for error handling instead of try-except block
- **Parameterizing a test**: Learned to use `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator for equivalence classes to parameterize inputs across multiple test functions
- **3-step pattern of functional test**: Understood the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern of the functional test
- **pytest fixture**: Learned that fixtures are used to inject dependency into test cases, creating assets required during the Arrange step in the Arrange-Act-Asser pattern
- **pytest test filtering options**: Discovered the various ways to filter tests cases in pytest by using directory/module path or `-k` command in command line and markers as name tags
